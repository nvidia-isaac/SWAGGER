- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide additional details in the body if needed

### Signing Your Work

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that:
- The contribution is your original work, OR
- You have the right to submit it under the same license, OR
- You have the right to submit it under a compatible license

**Any contribution containing commits that are not signed-off will not be accepted.**

The sign-off process uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), which is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.
